URL Cypher by Domain Expansion 🔐🌐
📌 Overview
This project focuses on classifying and analyzing URL-based datasets using advanced machine learning techniques. It applies feature engineering, domain-based grouping, and modern classifiers to improve the detection of patterns in URL structures.

📊 Technologies & Libraries Used
Python 🐍

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Category Encoders

NLTK

Seaborn, Matplotlib

📈 Workflow
Data Collection & Cleaning

Loaded URL data and performed null value checks and cleaning.

Feature Engineering

Created numerical and encoded categorical features.

Tokenized and stemmed URL text components.

Model Training & Evaluation

Applied multiple models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluated model performance using F1-Score and Classification Reports.

Result Visualization

Visualized feature importances and performance metrics.

📌 How to Run
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook URL_Cypher_by_Domain_Expansion.ipynb
Follow cell-by-cell execution.

📊 Results
Achieved significant F1-Score improvements via domain-specific feature engineering.

XGBoost outperformed baseline models on the dataset.

🌱 Future Improvements
Integrating additional NLP-based URL features like character entropy, suspicious keyword detection.

Deploying the final model as an interactive web-based API using FastAPI/Streamlit.

Incorporating deep learning methods (LSTM/CNN) for sequential URL pattern analysis.

Adding model explainability tools like SHAP to interpret predictions.
