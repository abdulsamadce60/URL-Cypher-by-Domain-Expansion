# URL Cypher by Domain Expansion 🔐🌐

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on classifying and analyzing URL-based datasets using advanced machine learning techniques. It applies feature engineering, domain-based grouping, and modern classifiers to improve the detection of patterns in URL structures.

## 📊 Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- Category Encoders  
- NLTK  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded URL data and performed null value checks and cleaning.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created numerical and encoded categorical features.  
   - Tokenized and stemmed URL text components.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Applied multiple models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
   - Evaluated model performance using F1-Score and Classification Reports.

4. **Result Visualization**  
   - Visualized feature importances and performance metrics.

## 📌 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook URL_Cypher_by_Domain_Expansion.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow cell-by-cell execution.

## 📊 Results

- Achieved significant F1-Score improvements via domain-specific feature engineering.
- XGBoost outperformed baseline models on the dataset.

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Integrating additional NLP-based URL features like character entropy, suspicious keyword detection.
- Deploying the final model as an interactive web-based API using FastAPI/Streamlit.
- Incorporating deep learning methods (LSTM/CNN) for sequential URL pattern analysis.
- Adding model explainability tools like SHAP to interpret predictions.
